	<img class="job_pic" src="/images/icons/DF/43285.jpg"
width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Graphic Artist" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Graphic designers - or graphic artists - plan,
analyze, and create visual solutions to communication problems.
They find the most effective way to get messages across in print,
electronic, and film media using a variety of methods such as color,
type, illustration, photography, animation, and various print and
layout techniques. An increasing number of graphic designers also
develop material for Internet Web pages, interactive media, and
multimedia projects. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>A bachelor's or an associate degree in graphic
design is usually required for a job as a graphic designer.  Graphic
designers must keep up with new and updated software on their own
or through software training programs.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>The median annual wage of graphic designers was
$47,640 in May 2016. </blockquote>

<hr size="1" />

	<span class="header2">Dispensing Optician</span><br /><br />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>In this job you would work with the two types
of eye doctors, ophthalmologists and optometrists. Your duties would
be to fill the prescriptions for eyeglasses and contact lenses. You
would help patients pick out frames as well.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>A high school diploma is all that is required to
get into this occupation, but most workers have completed at least
some college courses or a degree. Twenty-one states require
individuals to pass one or more of the following for licensure: a
state practical examination, a state written examination, and
certification examinations offered by the American Board of
Opticianry (ABO) and the National Contact Lens Examiners (NCLE).
</blockquote>

width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Computer Scientist" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Computer scientists work as theorists,
researchers, or inventors. The areas of computer science research
range from complex theory to hardware design to programming-language
design. Some researchers work on multidisciplinary projects, such as
developing and advancing uses of virtual reality, extending human-
computer interaction, or designing robots. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Most computer scientist positions require a
Ph.D. degree, as their main job function is research. Computer
scientists having only a bachelor's or master's degree are generally
limited in their ability to advance. Technological advances come so
rapidly in the computer field that continuous study is necessary to
keep one's skills up to date.</blockquote>

was $111,840 in May 2016. </blockquote>

	<span class="header2">Court Reporter</span><br /><br />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Courts are required to have somebody "record"
what is said in the courtroom during a trial or hearing. The person
who does this is a court reporter. As a court reporter, you would
use a special type of machine called a stenotype, which is a type of
computer that allows you to key in every word that the judge,
lawyers, and witnesses say. Some reporters work within the
courtroom. Other reporters are self-employed and they work in
different locations.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>The amount of training required to become a
court reporter varies with the type of reporting chosen. It can take
less than a year to become a novice voice writer, at least two years
to become proficient at real-time voice writing, and about three
years to become a real-time stenotypist. Skills can be learned on
the
job or through postsecondary vocational and technical school and
college programs. </blockquote>

replaced, repaired, or reimbursed by an insurance company. The
person who decides whether a "claim" is covered under an insurance
policy is an insurance claims adjuster. In this job, you would do a
lot of paperwork.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Training and entry requirements vary widely for
claims adjusters, appraisers, examiners, and investigators. Although
many in these occupations do not have a college degree, most

	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Automotive service technicians inspect,
maintain, and repair automobiles and light trucks that run on
gasoline, electricity, or alternative fuels such as ethanol.
Automotive service technicians' and mechanics' responsibilities have
evolved from simple mechanical repairs to high-level technology-
related work. They use computerized shop equipment and work with
electronic components while maintaining their skills with
traditional hand tools too. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>

the detailed instructions, called programs, that computers follow to
perform their functions. Programmers also conceive, design, and test
logical structures for solving problems by computer.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>A bachelor's degree commonly is required for
computer programming jobs, although a two-year degree or certificate
may be adequate for some positions. Employers favor applicants who

workers who keep up to date with the latest technology usually have
good opportunities for advancement. </blockquote>

services to clients after the systems are installed. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>While there is no universally accepted way to
prepare for a job as a network systems analyst, computer scientist,
or database administrator, most employers place a premium on some
formal college education. A bachelor's degree is a prerequisite for
many jobs; however, some jobs may require only a two-year degree.

is required, an internship or apprenticeship is generally required
before a technician is fully qualified.</blockquote>
