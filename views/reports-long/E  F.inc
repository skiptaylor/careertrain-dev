Technology (EF)</span>

<p>With an "EF" interest, you will want to push your physical and
mental strengths to their limits. You will want to be challenged and
have adventures along the way.</p>
<p>Many of the occupations in this pairing require some sort of
specialized training after high school. Some require college degrees
or college level courses.  For others, you will need technical
training.</p>
<p><strong>Courses you may want to consider taking in high school
and beyond (in addition to English & Math):</strong><br />
In high school you should take courses that allow you to challenge
your mind. You will want to take technical courses too.</p>

<span class="header1">MILITARY</span>
<p>There are many technical jobs in the military that offer
excitement and challenge. You may find one of these to be to your
liking.</p>

<hr size="1" />

	<span class="header2">Air Traffic
Controller</span><br /><br />
	<img class="job_pic" src="/images/icons/EF/43161.jpg"
width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Air Traffic Controller" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>An air traffic controller uses radar and
computer equipment to track aircraft while they are in the air. As
an air traffic controller, you would talk to the aircraft pilots at
take-off and landing. You would make sure that only one aircraft was
on the runway at a time. You would also make sure that they stayed a
certain distance from each other while they were in the air.  This
is an important job.  Many people's safety depends on the
controller.  You can also do this job as a civilian.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Training to become an air traffic controller is
very rigorous. Applicants must have three years of full-time work
experience and four years of college (or a combination of the two).
Then they must enroll in an FAA-approved education program and pass
a pre-employment test. Upon successful completion of an FAA-approved
program, those who receive school recommendation attend the FAA
Academy in Oklahoma City, OK, for 12 weeks of training. Then
applicants work two to four more years gaining on-the-job training
to become certified as professional air traffic controllers. Those
who have served in the military are exempted from some of the
requirements. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>The median annual wage of air traffic
controllers was $122,410 in May 2016. </blockquote>

<hr size="1" />

	<span class="header2">Pilot </span><br /><br />
	<img class="job_pic" src="/images/icons/EF/M041.jpg"
width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Air Crew Member" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Pilots are highly trained professionals who
either fly airplanes or helicopters. Except on small aircraft, two
pilots usually make up the cockpit crew. Generally the most
experienced pilot, the captain, is in command and supervises all
other crew members. The pilot and the copilot, often called the
first officer, share flying and other duties such as communicating
with air traffic controllers and monitoring the instruments.
</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>To qualify for FAA licensure, applicants must be
at least 18 years old and have at least 250 hours of flight
experience. All pilots who are paid to transport passengers or cargo
must have a commercial pilot's license with an instrument rating
issued by the FAA. Initial training for airline pilots typically
includes a week of company indoctrination; three to six weeks of
ground school and simulator training; and 25 hours of initial
operating experience, including a check-ride with an FAA aviation
safety inspector. Once trained, pilots are required to attend
recurrent training and simulator checks once or twice a year
throughout their career. Most pilots have a college degree. Many
pilots have served and been trained in the military. </blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>The median annual wage of pilots was $105,720 in
May 2016. </blockquote>

	<span class="header2">Cartographer or
Photogrammetrist</span><br /><br />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>Cartographers and photogrammetrists collect,
analyze, interpret, and map geographic information from surveys and
from data and photographs collected using airplanes and
satellites.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Cartographers and photogrammetrists usually have
a bachelor's degree in cartography, geography, surveying,
engineering, forestry, computer science, or a physical science,
although a few enter these positions after working as technicians.
</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>The median annual wage of cartographers was
$62,750 in May 2016. </blockquote>

	<img class="job_pic" src="/images/icons/EF/1168.jpg"
width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Truck Driver" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>As a truck driver, you would take loads of goods
and produce across the country to be sold. You would be responsible
for whatever you were hauling in your truck until you delivered it
to its drop-off.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations require
truck drivers to be at least 21 years old, have at least 20/40
vision and good hearing, and be able to read and speak English. They
also must have good driving records and a commercial driver's
license, which they obtain by passing a written examination and a
skills test in which they operate the type of vehicle they will be
driving. Some truck drivers enter the occupation by attending
training schools. Many large trucking companies have formal training
programs that prospective drivers attend. Other companies assign
experienced drivers to teach and mentor newer drivers.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>The median annual wage of truck drivers was
$41,340 in May 2016. </blockquote>

ground crew in the loading, unloading, securing, and staging of
aircraft cargo or baggage. They determine the quantity and
orientation of cargo and compute aircraft center of gravity. The
Cargo and Freight Agent may accompany aircraft as a
member of a flight crew and monitor and handle cargo in flight, and
assist and brief passengers on safety and emergency
procedures.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Most Cargo and Freight Agents learn
from work experience rather than from post-secondary training. It
will be important to be a good leader to be successful in this
job.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Salary</span>
	<blockquote>According to the online O*Net Resource Center, onetonline.org,
the median annual wage of Cargo and Freight Agents was $41,920 in
February 2018.</blockquote>

closely with environmental engineers and scientists in developing
methods and devices used in the prevention, control, or correction
of environmental hazards. They inspect and maintain equipment
related to air pollution and recycling. Some inspect water and
wastewater treatment systems to ensure that pollution control
requirements are met.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Most engineering technicians enter the
occupation with an associate degree in engineering technology. Those
preparing to work in environmental engineering technology need
courses in environmental regulations and safe handling of hazardous
materials. Training is available at technical institutes, community
colleges, extension divisions of colleges and universities, public
and private vocational-technical schools, and in the Armed Forces.

of construction, from the building of highways and bridges to the
installation of kitchen cabinets. Carpenters construct, erect,
install, and repair structures and fixtures made from wood and other
materials. </blockquote>

school with classes in English, algebra, geometry, physics,
mechanical drawing, blueprint reading, and general shop. After high
school some people get a job as a carpenter's helper, assisting

restore function, improve mobility, relieve pain, and prevent or
limit permanent physical disabilities of patients suffering from
injuries or disease. They restore, maintain, and promote overall
fitness and health. Treatment often includes exercise, especially
for patients who have been immobilized or who lack flexibility,
strength, or endurance. Physical therapists also use electrical
stimulation, hot packs or cold compresses, and ultrasound to relieve
pain and reduce swelling. They may use traction or deep-tissue
massage to relieve pain and improve circulation and flexibility.
Therapists also teach patients to use assistive and adaptive
devices such as crutches, prostheses, and wheelchairs. </blockquote>
