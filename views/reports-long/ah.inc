<span class="header1">Outdoor paired with Science/Mathematics (AH)
</span>

<p>If you scored high in the "A" and "H" categories, you can play an
important role in understanding, protecting and exploring the laws
of nature. People with your interests have contributed much to our
development, discovery and application of knowledge in this
area. "AH" people are usually excellent thinkers and appliers of
their knowledge. They are also creative scientists who have a great
respect for nature. They often find new ways to solve old problems
in all fields.</p>
<p>Most occupations in this pairing require at least a bachelor's
degree and many will require a master's degree or Ph.D.</p>
<p><strong>Courses you may want to take in high school and beyond
(in addition to English & Math):</strong><br />
In high school you should take courses in math and science. Courses
about the outdoors and nature will be of great interest to you. They
will also help prepare you for a possible career in this field.</p>
