	<blockquote>Legislators do not have to have a degree, but
most people who are elected do have a degree. The most common
degrees are law, public administration, and political science. In
addition, people vote for candidates who have experience in
planning. They also prefer legislators who can negotiate and

a good listener so that you can take in information while a witness
or suspect is talking.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Applicants usually must have at least a high

hospitality management for management trainee positions; however, a
liberal arts degree coupled with experience in the hospitality field
