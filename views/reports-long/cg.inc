an assessment of them before they were hired.</blockquote>

	<blockquote>Legislators do not have to have a degree, but
most people who are elected do have a degree. The most common
degrees are law, public administration, and political science. In
addition, people vote for candidates who have experience in
planning. They also prefer legislators who can negotiate and

scene and take in as much information as possible. You also must be
a good listener so that you can take in information while a witness
or suspect is talking.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>Applicants usually must have at least a high

comfortable during their stay. One of the most important duties you

properly.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>

hire people who have a bachelor's degree in business, hotel, or
hospitality management for management trainee positions; however, a
liberal arts degree coupled with experience in the hospitality field
may be sufficient. At other hotels, especially those with fewer
