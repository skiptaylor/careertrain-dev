the good things your company has done.  To do this, you would write
press releases, brochures, and television and radio announcements.
It would be important that you were enthusiastic about the company.

clearly.</blockquote>

graduates who combine a degree in public relations, journalism, or
another communications-related field with a public relations
internship or other related work experience.</blockquote>

degree preferably in communications, journalism, or English, but a
degree in a technical subject may be useful for technical writing
positions. For example, writers who work on computer manuals usually
have a degree in computer science.</blockquote>

good "eye," you might become a professional photographer. A
photographer combines communications skills and technology.  In this
job, you would take pictures of people, things, or events. You must
be creative.  Your goal is to show people something they might
otherwise not have seen.  You must understand the technical aspects
of the camera.  You must know how to process film too. Many
photographers work for themselves.  So, it is helpful to understand
how a small business works.</blockquote>
	<span class="header3">Education</span>
	<blockquote>A bachelor's degree in photography or the visual
arts can develop your basic skills.  But, you also need to be
creative to succeed in this field.  Spend as much time as possible

photography clubs and working in photo shops and labs will help you

width="100" height="100" border="0" alt="Video Editor" />
	<span class="header3">Job Description</span>
	<blockquote>When you watch a movie or television program,
you are watching more than the work of actors.  You are watching the
work of a video editor, too.  As a video editor, you would use your
creativity to piece together the footage of a film or program. You
would have two goals.  You would want to be sure the audience could
understand the story.  You also want to edit the film so that the
audience could "feel" the movie.  You would use video equipment to
make the movie seem exciting, dramatic, funny, or scary.</blockquote>

operators and editors usually acquire their skills through formal
postsecondary training at vocational schools, colleges,
universities, or photographic institutes. A bachelor's degree may be

that helps the actors look better on stage.  If you would like to be
a part of a drama production, but not want to be an actor or
director, this may be a job for you.  As a lighting designer, you
would use your technical know-how to make the lighting on stage
reflect the "feeling" of the play. For example, if the scene were
set in the middle of an electrical storm you would make sure there
were flashes of light on stage.</blockquote>
