					Before presenting the <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> workshop, register your school 
					(organization) to generate a password so students can access the Online Career 
					Direction 2 Career Planning Tools.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					You should give the password to your students during your <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> 
					presentation.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The <i>Careers and Occupations Guide Report</i> provides students with a customized 
					career planning report based on the <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> exercise. The exercise allows students to explore personal interests and is a supplement to the CD2 program. It is not available in all states. Because the CD2 exercise is easily self-scored, students can create these reports immediately if the optional exercise is conducted. If the interest exercise is not used, students can simply select two of the career categories they find intriguing based on the description in the CD2 workbook and create an immediate report.
					However, in order for Counselor and Recruiter reports to be generated by CTC, scanforms must 
					be returned to CTC.
				</p>
				
				<p>After the class, be sure to return CD2 exercise scanforms to CTC:</p>
