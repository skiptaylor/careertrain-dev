			<strong>Career Direction 2</strong> is an exclusive NPS entry tool available <em>only</em> 
			to Army National Guard RRNCOs. It is a valuable career guidance workshop that truly meets the needs of 
			students, parents, and educators.
		</p>
		<p>
			The program includes an optional <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> exercise for identifying students' career interests. Students 
			also indicate their post high school education plans. The program is easy for you to use, 
			as each carton contains:
		</p>
		<ul class="padleft">
			<li>
				Student <strong>workbooks,</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				Educator <strong>brochures,</strong>
			</li>
			<li>
				A slide show <strong>CD-ROM,</strong> and
			</li>
			<li>
				An <strong>RRNCO Information Sheet</strong> with instructions for maximizing your effectiveness in schools.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			As the guest classroom instructor for <strong>Career Direction 2,</strong> you are positioned 
			as a trusted adviser with whom students feel comfortable talking about their futures. The 
			program creates a "trust opportunity" for you to present the benefits of joining the 
			Guard to those who are good prospects.
		</p>
		<p>
			Clearly, not every student is a good candidate for the National Guard, but with <strong>Career 
			Direction 2,</strong> you can refine your leads through personal interaction with quality candidates.
			
					<p>
			This means your follow-up conversations with students and 
			their parents will be more relevant and productive, resulting in more enlistments.
		</p>
		<p>
			Data over the past 20 years show that about 25% of the student population we've tested had a high 
			interest in Protective/Military occupations. Additionally, some 14% of the student population indicated 
			an interest in joining the military. Like other ARNG RRNCOs around the country, you can use <strong>Career Direction 2</strong> 
			to meet and exceed your mission.</p>
