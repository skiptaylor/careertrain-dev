I currently hold a 3.8 grade point average and many of my classes that I have taken have specialized in working with people.
 
If I was to be apart of the large corporation known as Professional Business Associates, I feel I can be a positive addition to the company's success because of my experiences in leadership roles. Throughout high school I have taken on many leadership positions from sports to academics and have attended a couple leadership seminars such as HOBY and All Girls State.

My resume is attached. I truly appreciate your reading of this letter. I hope by this letter you have learned a little bit about me and if you have any questions regarding additional information please feel free to contact me by email at gibs4ever@yahoo.com or by phone at (208)-215-0708. I look forward to any further discussion regarding this position.
 Sincerely,

I had manage to possess a 3.5 grade point average within both Timberlake High School and Eastern Washington University. I am more than willing to learn new skills about how to handle young children and teenagers that will help me in doing my job correctly.
I have a feeling that I may have a great impact within the school district. I have been able to understand what children are like through my years of babysitting. I have also volunteered at Eastern Washington University to tutor children who live in the area that struggle in school. Having to work with these children has helped me for the better. I was able to gain the knowledge of teaching children, and gave me the opportunities to learn how children think and behave.
My resume and transcript are attached. I will appreciate your consideration of my credentials. If I can provide any additional information, I would very much appreciate it if you let me know. You can reach me by email at krhanimegirl@gmail.com or by phone at (208) 818-5099. I am looking forward to discussing my qualifications with you in person.

I am writing to you in response to the job opening that was mentioned on your website . As of now I am currently seeking a summer job and through all my searching I found that Skyzone was the better option to apply for. I believe that I can bring my skills and talent to the table to help benefit you and the company. 





I am currently  attending Johns Creek High School  as a sophomore and will next year be a junior. The past two summers I have participated/volunteered at Camp All American on the Yes Crew. Camp All American is a summer camp for the age groups preschool all the way to eighth grade, the campers do different activities, sports, and ropes course  with their counselors. Being a camper since preschool, I was elated to hear that they were having a something for highschool students called Yes Crew, which gave me the opportunity to be apart of the camp again.  As Yes Crew member  manning the camp store, setting up and breaking down each day for camp, supporting the customer service staff, and helping out with the ropes course. Our team was vitally important in keeping Camp All-American running smoothly. Throughout the last two summers I have learned how to , work with a team, handle responsibilities, and  also built up my leadership skills. Being placed into a teamwork environment, I took roles as being the leader of the team and keeping everything and everyone under control. Sometimes we had to watch over a counselors group or take the hurt campers to the clinic. It was our responsibility to make sure the the campers were safe while doing ropes course and playing sports. I know that through that experience I have learned to become responsible and reliable with not only other peoples kids but with important responsibilities and I believe that I can do the same at Sky Zone.  





At Sky Zone I can be wherever you want me to be whenever you need me to be there. Yes Crew lead me on the track of being on time, mainly ahead of time, in the morning and also to many different events I have attended. I believe that this is the type of person you need working at a place such as Sky Zone, someone efficient, on time, and reliable. To my understanding,  an employee at Sky Zone must be comfortable around kids and able to adapt to changes. Me being surround by little kids my whole life and having to take care of them, which I love, I feel as though I am prepared for the job. I love being around kids and taking care of them I truly improved my care skills through Yes Crew also due to being around so many campers.




I would love to get the opportunity to get an  interview with you or someone other than you for the job. It would be a great experience for me to work for Sky Zone this summer, in the way of becoming even more responsible and being able to learn the value of saving and earning money. I believe Sky Zone would be the perfect place for me to not only offer my skills but also to learn some new ones.

To be a part of your staff would be an honor be cause not only do I have a passion for healthcare science, but being a part of a team like yours would benefit both of us. I am the type of person who is willing to compromise and work with others to complete one common goal, and in this case, that would be to get as many patients in and out with good health. Im seeking my first job in this field, and I picked Candler because I know what you and your staff want to save as many lives as possible, and I truly believe that I would be the perfect addition. After realizing that I wanted a job in this facility, I began to research as much as I could about it.

When I saw that you were looking for a Neonatal Nurse, I knew that I would be a perfect fit for it. I have lots of experience when it comes to working with mothers and babies. During my internship at Effingham Hospital in Springfield GA, I found out that working with the mothers and their children is my passion. Being a part of bringing a new life into this world would not only be and honor, but it would truly make me happy with the job that I do. Anything that you need me to do, I will do with no problem. I work well with other, and I have many qualities and skills for this job, so I hope you will consider me greatly for the position of neonatal nurse.

My energy, enthusiasm, dedication, and ability to work well with others makes me a good candidate to be your newest neonatal nurse. I believe that I will make an amazing addition to your team at Candler, and I hope you take all that I have told you into consideration.

Dear Mr. Bergem:

In response to the November 7th advertisement in the Pineandlakes Echo Journal, I have enclosed my resume for the cashier position.

I have one summer of experience working at a resort as a dockboy. This included running the lodge, and helping people dock their boats so I have experienced conversing with people to help them enjoy their time spent at the resort. 

I am currently a senior in high school. During this time I have gained important skills on how to talk to other people in a more appropriate manner.

I welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications with you in person. I can be reached at (218) 587-4357. Thank you for your time and consideration

Sincerely,


Caleb Peterson

I plan to complete my transitions rotation in the critical unit at Johns Hopkins Hospital in the spring, and am confident that I will continue to develop as a nurse; particularly as I provide care to a diverse patient population.

In addition to my nursing skills, I have developed my leadership skills as well. As the president of the JHU chapter of the National Student Nurses' Association, I have planned several community service activities, including a blood drive for SON students with a 81% participation rate. Our chapter also created a program that provides infant care training to underserved mothers in the area. I am very interested in beginning my nursing career at Johns Hopkins Hospital and believe that my skills and experience prepare me well. I will contact you during the week of January 15 to discuss career opportunities. I look forward to meeting you, and please do not hesitate to contact me at 410-555-1234.""5794","14968","Mr.","John","Brown","Customer Service","Footlocker","3044 lenox square","Atlanta","GA","30254",,,"Mr. John Brown a close friend of mine, told me that i will be a great fit with the job because im great with money and customer service, i would appreciate it if you consider me for the job""5796","14970","Ms.","Kierra","Beale","store manager","Rue 21","2968 Simons Boulevard","miami","Florida","36619",,,"Ms. Joe Brown, a friend, told me your company is seeking for store managers.
